# Personal Portfolio Website 

You can visit the live version of this website at [nckdhl.com](https://nckdhl.com) (deployed with Netlify).

This project was my first foray into the world of React and JS frontend frameworks. 
It may have been a tad much to build such a simple site with React. 
Nevertheless, it allowed me to get my feet wet with React.

*Enjoy!*
